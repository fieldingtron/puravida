Urubamba is located close to cusco

Eternal Cusco, poetry of the time, where the Inca joins the colonial lineage in hybrid romance.

Magical charm and sad music, 

colorful dances as Inti Raymi, 

mystical devotion in Corpus Cristi, 

wide skirts and short ponchos;

with your churches and cathedrals of colonial style, 

carpeted with your beautiful stone streets, 

with memories of Inca treads 

going up and down in a rhythmic melody .


Cusco, often referred to as the "Historical Capital of Peru," was once the capital of the Inca Empire. Founded in the 12th century, it became the heart of one of the most advanced civilizations in the Americas. The city was later conquered by Spanish forces in the 16th century, leading to a fusion of Inca and colonial Spanish cultures. Today, Cusco is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and proximity to the famous Machu Picchu.


The Sacred Valley of Peru, also known as the Urubamba Valley, is a region in the Andes near Cusco. It was highly valued by the Inca civilization due to its fertile lands and strategic location. The valley is home to numerous archaeological sites, including Pisac, Ollantaytambo, and Chinchero, which showcase the advanced engineering and agricultural techniques of the Incas.

The Sacred Valley is also known for its breathtaking landscapes, with towering mountains, terraced fields, and the Urubamba River running through it. Visitors can explore traditional Andean villages, vibrant markets, and experience local culture and traditions. The valley serves as a gateway to Machu Picchu and offers a variety of outdoor activities such as hiking, rafting, and mountain biking.
