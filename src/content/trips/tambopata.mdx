Tambopata National Reserve harbors some of the wildest, least impacted habitats in the world. In this one million plus hectare protected area, rainforests and tropical savannahs meet in a land where roads have never existed and rivers are the only means of accessing its dense forests and bird-filled marshes. This huge wilderness gets its name from the Ese-Eja words for "Tambopata" (Bahuaja) and "Heath" (Sonene).

Buffered by the 274,690 hectare Tambopata National Reserve, the deep, wildlife-filled jungles are rarely visited by people. In fact, very little access is actually given to the national park itself to keep it preserved as a true, Amazonian wilderness.

Located in the Tambopata-Candamo National Reserve, we believe this exceeds expectations of a wild and remote river that offers an exciting whitewater adventure in the pristine rainforest of the Peruvian Amazon. A great variety of tropical plant and animal species abound in this remote and unspoiled area to which the river is the only access route. It has the greatest diversity of wildlife: more than five hundred twenty species of birds, one thousand two hundred species of butterflies and many groups of animals, such as the howler monkey, tapir, capybaras, macaws, giant otters, black and white caiman, ocelot and the majestic jaguar. All this has forced the Peruvian Government to protect this area and create this National Reserve.

Our expedition begins in Cusco, the heart of the Inca Empire. We will travel through the high plateau of the Andes to enter one of the last uninhabited forests in the world, with twenty thousand plant species, thousand species of birds, hundreds of mammals, reptiles and fish. We will be floating for seven days, encountering exciting class III and IV rapids.

We will sail approximately three hundred kilometers through the upper part of the Tambopata River to the Madre de Dios River, which are important tributaries of the great Amazon River. We will have the opportunity to camp in front of the largest macaw clay lick in South America before hopping on a motor boat to finally reach the city of Puerto Maldonado.

We will witness the upper reaches of the Amazon basin from the snows of the Andean peaks to the tropical jungle, and we will delight ourselves with llamas and alpacas in the highlands, and thousands of colorful macaws in the "Colpa" in the low jungle.

## Detailed Itinerary

### Day 2: Rafting on the Tambopata River

We will arrive to the town of Curva Alegre and before we start guides will give an orientation briefing and we will prepare all the rafting equipment. We will enjoy class II and III rapids this day!

### Days 4 & 5: Sailing on the Tambopata River

### Day 7: Chuncho Colpa

Before breakfast, at first light, we will take a short walk to the "Colpa of the Guacamayos" (Macaw Lick), the largest known Macaw Lick where on a normal day, hundreds of Macaws and other parrots come in the morning to lick the salty rich clay. This is one of the greatest birding spectacles in the world and a unique experience for photographers. After a good day of paddling in very calm waters we will arrive at Colpa Chuncho. Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.
