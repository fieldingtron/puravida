The Apurimac River, whose name in Quechua means "Great Speaker" or "Oracle," is considered the most powerful of the Incas oracles which spoke through tremendous river rapids. This majestic river descends violently from 5,000 meters into a gigantic gorge, forming one of the most impressive spectacles of nature. The Apurimac has its most distant source in the Snowy Misti (5,597 m) in the Arequipa region and flows northwest, eventually joining the Amazon River system on its journey to the Atlantic Ocean.

This sacred Inca river offers a challenging adventure through pristine wilderness. With no large settlements along its banks, the Apurimac presents nothing but pure, untamed nature. From its lofty source where it begins its journey through pastoral valleys until it starts its meanderings through the depths of the jungle, the river cuts through wild gorges and canyons, with almost inaccessible cliffs and gigantic walls that reach toward the peaks of the Cordillera Vilcabamba at more than 13,200 feet.

The three-day journey begins with a drive through dramatic Andean landscapes and villages to reach Huallpachaca Bridge (1,700 feet), where the rafting adventure begins. The first day offers a gentle introduction with Class II and III rapids before camping by the shore. Day two brings adrenaline-pumping excitement through spectacular canyons and legendary Class V rapids with names like "Z," "Laberinto," and "Dolor de Muelas." The final day challenges even the most experienced rafters with famous rapids such as "Ultima Sonrisa" and "Babalua Carajo!" before the canyon opens up to the take-out point. Throughout the journey, the towering cliffs, crystal clear waters, and the powerful spirit of the "talkative God" combine to create an unforgettable Peruvian adventure.
