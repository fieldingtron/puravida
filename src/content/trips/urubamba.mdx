Descending a whitewater river on an inflatable raft, we are going to paddle under the instructions of an experienced guide. Challenge yourself through exciting rapids, while enjoying the surrounding natural beauty of the Sacred Valley and mountain range view. Everybody can practice rafting, from the absolute beginners to the more experienced ones, but above all it's important not to have fear of being in the water!

The Urubamba River flows through the Sacred Valley, also known as the Urubamba Valley, a region in the Andes near Cusco. This area was highly valued by the Inca civilization due to its fertile lands and strategic location. The valley is home to numerous archaeological sites, including Pisac, Ollantaytambo, and Chinchero, which showcase the advanced engineering and agricultural techniques of the Incas.

Cusco, often referred to as the "Historical Capital of Peru," was once the capital of the Inca Empire. Founded in the 12th century, it became the heart of one of the most advanced civilizations in the Americas. The city was later conquered by Spanish forces in the 16th century, leading to a fusion of Inca and colonial Spanish cultures. Today, Cusco is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and proximity to the famous Machu Picchu.

The Sacred Valley is known for its breathtaking landscapes, with towering mountains, terraced fields, and the Urubamba River running through it. Visitors can explore traditional Andean villages, vibrant markets, and experience local culture and traditions. The valley serves as a gateway to Machu Picchu and offers a variety of outdoor activities such as hiking, rafting, and mountain biking.

## Sample Itinerary

Each raft can run with a minimum of 2 up to a maximum of 7 people, in addition to the professional guide, who can speak English. You will be given the necessary information about how to paddle and what to do, as well as safety instructions, and you will practice shortly out of the water before starting the run.

We will start our journey on easy waters while admiring the spectacular views of the mountains and archaeological remains. The scenery is beautiful and gives us the chance to see villagers working on their crops, fishermen, and Andean wild birds.
