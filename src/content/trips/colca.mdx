The canyon was formed by a massive geological fault between the two enormous volcanoes of Coropuna (6425m) and Ampato (6318m), eroded over thousands of years by the longest river on the Peruvian coast. The Colca River reaches depths of up to 3,400 meters on both slopes, extends over 200 km long, and forms part of a gigantic watershed that empties into the Pacific.

Colca Canyon is one of the deepest canyons in the world, located in southern Peru. It is renowned for its breathtaking landscapes, traditional villages, and as a habitat for the Andean condor, a majestic bird with a wingspan of up to 3 meters. The canyon is a popular destination for trekking, cultural tourism, and birdwatching. Visitors can also explore pre-Inca terraces still used for agriculture and enjoy hot springs in the surrounding area.

Lovers of wild and magnificent nature should not miss a chance to get to know the Lunar Canyon of the Colca and its neighboring regions. The canyon itself, with walls that reach at least 4000 meters above the level of the river on one side and more than 3000 m on the other, is incomparable. It is the deepest known canyon in the world.

From its crystalline waters, the walls often open to vistas of towering snow peaks. The "Cruz del Condor," at the foot of Mt. Mismi, from whose north slope flows the Apurimac River and thus the Amazon, and the "Chocolate Canyon," are of unimaginable gigantic proportions.

For canoeists, the Colca is beyond compare. The technical difficulties at times are almost insurmountable and put even the most skillful to the test. They are compensated by the adventure and excitement of running a river devoid of all vegetation, accompanied by otters and black salmon in the waters and condors in the skies, surrounded by lunar landscapes and figures carved by erosion into the rocks and volcanic lava, and the colors of the walls with their intermixed geological strata. It is one of the most beautiful, the most thrilling, the most interesting rivers of the world.

Very exciting day in this colorful canyon. Class V rapids (Possible portages). Camp. Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.

### Day 6: Colca River

The speed of the current makes it possible to navigate swiftly, maneuvering easily between the large boulders in the riverbed.
