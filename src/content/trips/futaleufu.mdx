The Futaleufú River, whose name means "Big River" in the indigenous Mapuche language, is widely considered one of the most beautiful and challenging whitewater rivers in the world. Flowing from Argentina into Chile through the heart of Patagonia, the Futaleufú cuts through a pristine valley of extraordinary beauty, with turquoise waters that originate from snowmelt in the Andes Mountains.

Protected by its remote location and the creation of Futaleufú National Reserve, the river and its surrounding wilderness offer a remarkable adventure through one of the last great wild places on earth. The deep, crystal-clear waters flow through impressive canyons and valleys, surrounded by granite cliffs, lush forests, and the snow-capped peaks of the Andes.

Our expedition begins in Puerto Montt, Chile, from where we journey to the small town of Futaleufú. The river offers a perfect blend of exhilarating rapids and calm stretches, allowing time to appreciate the stunning landscapes. With names like "Terminator," "Casa de Piedra," and "Throne Room," the rapids on the Futaleufú are legendary among whitewater enthusiasts around the world.

We will spend seven full days on the river, tackling different sections each day and returning to our comfortable riverside camp each evening. The unique biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia surrounds us throughout the journey, with opportunities to spot condors soaring overhead, huemul deer in the forests, and a variety of other native wildlife.

The pristine waters of the Futaleufú not only provide world-class rafting but are also home to exceptional fishing opportunities, with rainbow and brown trout abundant in its clear depths. Our adventure combines the thrill of navigating world-class rapids with peaceful moments to appreciate the remarkable natural beauty and tranquility of this remote Patagonian paradise.
