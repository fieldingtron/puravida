The Futaleufú River, whose name means "Big River" in the indigenous Mapuche language, is widely considered one of the most beautiful rivers in the world. Flowing from Argentina into Chile through the heart of Patagonia, the Futaleufú cuts through a pristine valley of extraordinary beauty, with turquoise waters that originate from snowmelt in the Andes Mountains.

Protected by its remote location and the creation of Futaleufú National Reserve, the river and its surrounding wilderness offer a remarkable adventure through one of the last great wild places on earth. The deep, crystal-clear waters flow through impressive canyons and valleys, surrounded by granite cliffs, lush forests, and the snow-capped peaks of the Andes.

Our Futaleufú Magical adventure offers a perfect balance of exciting activities and peaceful moments to appreciate the stunning Patagonian landscapes. Based at the comfortable Monastery lodge throughout the trip, you'll enjoy diverse experiences including moderate rafting on the legendary Futaleufú River, scenic treks to magnificent waterfalls and viewpoints, horseback riding through pristine wilderness, and paddling inflatable kayaks (duckies) on the beautiful Azul River.

This multi-activity journey combines adventure with opportunities to appreciate the remarkable natural beauty and tranquility of this remote Patagonian paradise. With professional guides leading each activity and all meals provided at the lodge, you can fully immerse yourself in the magic of Futaleufú.
