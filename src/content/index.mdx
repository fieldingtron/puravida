faqs:
  - question: "What experience level is required for your rafting trips?"
    answer: "Our trips accommodate all levels, from beginners on our Class II-III trips like Urubamba to experienced rafters seeking Class V challenges on the Futaleufú, Cotahuasi, and Colca rivers. Our guides provide comprehensive safety training and instruction before every trip."

  - question: "What's included in the trip price?"
    answer: "Our prices typically include professional guides, safety equipment, rafting gear, all meals during the expedition, camping equipment, and scheduled transfers. International airfare, sleeping bags, personal gear, and gratuities are generally not included. Check each specific trip for full details."

  - question: "How physically demanding are the trips?"
    answer: "Trip difficulty varies from moderate half-day adventures to demanding multi-day expeditions. Longer trips like Cotahuasi include a challenging 14-mile hike. We recommend being in good physical condition, especially for Class IV-V trips that require strength and stamina for consecutive days of paddling."

  - question: "What safety measures do you have in place?"
    answer: "Safety is our primary concern. We employ professional guides with swift water rescue and wilderness first responder certifications, provide comprehensive safety equipment, conduct thorough briefings, use safety kayakers on challenging runs, and carry first-aid kits. Our itineraries are designed with safety contingencies in mind."

  - question: "What wildlife might we see during the trips?"
    answer: "Wildlife varies by location. In Peru's Tambopata, you might see macaws, monkeys, capybaras, giant otters, and possibly jaguars. The Colca Canyon is known for Andean condors, while Chilean Patagonia offers opportunities to spot condors, huemul deer, and various bird species. Each ecosystem offers unique biodiversity experiences."

  - question: "What should I pack for a rafting expedition?"
    answer: "Essential items include quick-drying clothes, swimwear, sun protection (hat, sunscreen, sunglasses with retention strap), water bottle, personal medications, and toiletries. For multi-day trips, bring a headlamp, warm layers for evenings, and a small towel. A complete packing list is provided prior to departure."

  - question: "What are the sleeping arrangements on multi-day trips?"
    answer: "On multi-day river expeditions, we camp on beaches or designated sites, often in spectacular settings like Inca terraces on the Cotahuasi or pristine beaches in Tambopata. We provide double-occupancy tents and camping equipment, though you'll need to bring your own sleeping bag and pad (rentals may be available)."

  - question: "How challenging are the rapids on your various trips?"
    answer: "Our trips range from Class II-III (Urubamba) suitable for beginners to Class V (Futaleufú, Cotahuasi, Colca, Apurimac) for experienced rafters. Class II-III features moderate rapids with regular waves, while Class IV-V involves powerful currents, complex maneuvers, and potentially dangerous conditions requiring advanced skills and experience."

  - question: "What kind of cultural experiences can I expect?"
    answer: "Many of our trips offer rich cultural experiences, from exploring ancient Inca ruins along the Cotahuasi to visiting traditional Andean villages. You'll experience local cuisine, potentially interact with indigenous communities, and gain insights into the historical and cultural significance of these remote regions."

  - question: "Do I need prior rafting experience for the expeditions?"
    answer: "For beginner trips like Urubamba (Class II-III), no experience is necessary. For challenging Class IV-V expeditions like Futaleufú or Colca, previous rafting experience is strongly recommended. Even on easier trips, your guides will provide thorough instruction and safety briefings before you start."

  - question: "What happens in case of medical emergencies in remote locations?"
    answer: "Our guides are trained in wilderness first response and carry appropriate first-aid supplies. For serious emergencies, we have evacuation protocols specific to each river. Due to the remote nature of many of our trips, comprehensive travel insurance with emergency evacuation coverage is required for all participants."

  - question: "When is the best time to go rafting in Peru and Chile?"
    answer: "The optimal rafting season varies by location. In Peru, the best time is typically from May to November during the dry season. The Futaleufú in Chile runs from December to March during the southern hemisphere summer. Each river has its prime season when water levels and weather conditions are optimal."
